# busMall

Creating a app to help market a bus mall magazine for bus companies. It will give you a choice of what item to choose between for marketing purposes. The items will be displayed 3 at a time and you will be able to choose between the three. The results will show once the user has made 25 choices. The final result will show the total number of clicks that an item was clicked on. The marketing team will also use the percentages of the items that are clicked. 

End User:
1. I want to view three images as products on the screen an be able to choose between them. 
2. After I click on the object I want to see 3 new objects to choose from. 
3. I want to continue to see the objects as I click through 25 times. 
4. Once I have chosen between 3 items 25 times I want to see the results of what I chose.
5. I want to see this in an asthetically pleasing way with easy functionality.

Developer:
1. Need to create objects that shows a list of random images.
2. Need to have this done in a grid from so that the images show across the top of the page side by side. 
3. Want to have a title and directions so that the user knows what to do in the app. 
4. Need to have the images show up randomally and differently after each click.
5. Need to have 25 times that three different images show up after each click.
6. Must keep track of the number of clicks each image gets.
7. Must show a graph or table of the results which is how many times an image is clicked.

Questions:
1. Can you see an image more than one time in the 25 choices? --Would be nice but not required.
